# SASC:  A Simple Approach to Synthetic Cohort Generation
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Fraunhofer-ITMP/SASC/v1.0?urlpath=shiny//)

[Public COVID-19 reference data](https://github.com/HAIRLAB/Pre_Surv_COVID_19/tree/v1.0/data) have been used for the following Shiny to generate synthetic data via the SASC algorithm. Here a comparison through the Kaplan-Meier plots is provided so that the parameters chosen for the virtual cohort can be checked against the real-world data.

- **Data** - *PreSurv* data can be found [here](https://github.com/HAIRLAB/Pre_Surv_COVID_19/tree/v1.0/data)
- **Shiny App** - Click the binder icon on the top to run the current SASC version application.

<b>TO NOTE: The app is heavy on server side, and it can be slow - be patient.</b> 

## What do you see in the app?
In the app, one can compare the Kaplan-Meier plots for each parameter (found in the cohort) for the virtual cohort and real-world data


## Issues
If you have difficulties using the app, please open an issue at our bug-tracker on [GitHub](https://github.com/Fraunhofer-ITMP/SASC/issues).
